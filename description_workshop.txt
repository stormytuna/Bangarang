Bangarang is a mod that overhauls the Boomerang subclass of melee weapons, making them more diverse, giving them unique effects and adding an array of new boomerangs

Vanilla changes are pretty small in this mod, giving some boomerangs minor effects, giving a couple boomerangs crafting recipes and allowing stacking boomerangs to receive modifiers

New boomerangs are available throughout your entire progression. From the Shade Chakram, an early pre-hardmode boomerang that slightly homes on enemies, to the White Dwarf, an endgame boomerang that incinerates all it touches. This mod also adds a handful of accessories that support Boomerangs, increasing how many you can throw, how fast they return and more
